# A-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Image-Classification
In this project, i created machine learning model for image classification. The data set folder (named with DS) contains 1500 CT scans of various parts of body such as abdomen, chest, and head. I created a CNN model and extracted the features from the images. I applied K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to the extracted features and predicted the optimal k value. then, I applied the Random Forest (RF) model to the extracted features and tuned two parameters using random search.  
The project is about implementation of convolution neural network (CNN) to extract
features from the images in a dataset. The dataset used in this model contains totally 1500
CT scans of various parts of body such as abdomen, chest, and head. In this report, CNN is
built from scratch to extract features from the dataset. Here the features are extracted from
intermediate dense layer. After extracting the features, the K -nearest neighbor (KNN)
algorithm is applied to the extracted features and determining the optimal KNN model. At
last, Random forest algorithm is applied to the extracted features and tuning the two
hyperparameters using random search to obtain better performance.
